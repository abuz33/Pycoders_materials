# Class4-Machine_Learning-Week25

Hello Everyone, 

https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package

We will use the linked dataset. We want you to set the 'RainToday' variable as the dependent variable and set up a model that predicts whether there will be rain or not. This model will be made using; 

* 'Desicion Tree', 
* 'Random Forest', 
* 'LightGBM', 
* 'GBM', 
* 'XGBoost', 
* 'CatBoost' models. 

You can use all the methods you have learned so far (Variable engineering studies, determining Nan values, dummy variables, etc..) . The aim will be to establish the model with the highest performance. This performance measure is not just an accuracy score. You should also evaluate using the Confusion Matrix (Recall, Precision, F1-score) that we have seen in the lesson. And we also expect ROC curve graph of each model to be displayed on a single graph. 

After you've done your assignment on Kaggle, you have to upload the Kaggle link into Github. 

### Good luck
