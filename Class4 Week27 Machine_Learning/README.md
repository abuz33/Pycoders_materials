# Class4-Machine_Learning-Week27

This week you are asked to create a recommendation system algorithm for the hotels listed in the attached csv file.

You will indicate the hotel name and number of recommended hotel as an input and the algorithm will show the recommended hotels as output (For instance: ''Radison Hotel'' and ''3'' will be the user input and the algo will show 3 recommended hotel as a list).

Pearson correlation, cosinus similarity or euclidean distance can be used while finding similarity between hotels.

Please make sure to upload the link of your study into github.

Good luck...
