## 1 - Random Password 
As a user, I want to use a program which can generate random password and display the result on user interface. So that I can generate my password for any application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Password length must be `10` characters long. 
* It must contain at least `2` upper case letter, `2` digits and `2` special symbols.
* You must import some required modules or packages.
* The GUI of program must contain at least a button and a label.
* The result should be display on the password label when the user click the generate button.

## 2 - The Least Common Multiple
As a user, I want to use a program which can calculate the least common multiple (L.C.M.) of four numbers. So that I can find the least common multiple (L.C.M.) of my inputs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Ask user to enter the four numbers.
* Use `try/except` blocks to verify input entries and warn the user for Nan or non numerical inputs.
* Calculate the least common multiple (L.C.M.) of four numbers 
* Use gcd function in module of math


## 3- Number Guessing Game
As a player,  I want to play a game which I can guess a number the computer chooses in the range I chose. So that I can try to find the correct number which was selected by computer.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Computer must randomly pick an integer from user selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer. 
* Your program should prompt the user for guesses 
* if the user guesses incorrectly, it should print whether the guess is too high or too low. 
* If the user guesses correctly, the program should print total time and total number of guesses. 
* You must import some required modules or packages
* You can assume that the user will enter valid input.

## 4- Mis Calculator
As a user, I want to use a program which can calculate basic  mathematical operations. So that I can add, subtract, multiply or divide my inputs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* The calculator must support the Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and  Division operations.
* Define four functions in four files for each of them, with two float numbers as parameters.
* To calculate the answer, use math.ceil()  and get the next integer value greater than the result 
* Create a menu using the print command with the respective options and take an input choice from the user.
* Using if/elif statements for cases and call the appropriate functions.
* Use try/except blocks to verify input entries and warn the user for incorrect inputs.
* Ask user if calculate numbers again. To implement this, take the input from user `Y` or `N`.
