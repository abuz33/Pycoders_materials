# Class4-PythonModule-Week6

Create a class named `Triangle` and  `Rectangle`.

Create a subclass named `Square` inherited from `Rectangle`.

Create a subclass named `Cube` inherited from `Square`.

Create a subclass named `Pyramid` multiple inherited both from `Triangle` and `Square`.

Two dimensional classes (`Triangle`, `Rectangle` and `Square`) should have:
*	its dimensions as attributes.(can be inherited from a superclass) 
*	methods which calculate its area and perimeter separately.
Three dimensional classes (`Cube` and `Pyramid`) should have:
*	its dimensions as attributes which are inherited from a superclass
*	its extra dimensions if there is. (hint: maybe for `Pyramid`)
*	methods which calculate its volume and surface area separately. (surface area is optional, you may not do this)
