## Question 1:

Implement a stack that supports push and pop operations using standard enqueue and dequeue operations of the queue.

## Question 2:

Implement a queue using a single linked list. (Hint: Enqueuing happens at the tail of the list, and the dequeuing of items happens at the head of the list.)

## Question 3:

Given a positive number n, efficiently generate binary numbers between 1 and n using the queue data structure in linear time.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`n = 10` 

**Output :** 

`1 10 11 100 101 110 111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111 10000`
